"What is the difference between the first Form_2 function and the second?"

    In the first form, there are State for fullName and handler for fullName when we change the First & Last Name
    In the second form, there are no State and Handler. It is changed into normal variable.

"Why is it necessary to delete the fullName state? What are the advantages?"

    Because it is make a redundant state, if we not change it, it will make a bug in the application. 
    The advantages is the application use less computing and become bug-free.
